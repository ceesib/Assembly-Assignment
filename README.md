Readme for Assembly Code 1 (Updating an ASCII PPM Image to a brighter one and calculating Average Pixel Value)

Overview:
This assembly code is designed to perform the following tasks:

Read an ASCII PPM image file.
Convert the image to an ASCII PPM image file that is brighter
Calculate the average pixel value of the original image.
Write the image to a new PPM file.
Display the average pixel value of the original image and the new image on the console.
How to Use:
1. Create a new output file (ppm)
2. In order to run in the code you need to hard code the file path onto my code(for both the input and output files) as mips doesn't read the user input properly
3. Run the code using a MIPS assembly simulator or emulator.
4. After execution, the increase_brightness image will be saved as "increase_brightness.ppm" in the same directory.
5. The program will display the average pixel values of the original and the new image on the console.

Additional Notes:

The code uses MIPS assembly language and is designed to be run on a MIPS architecture.
Ensure that you have a compatible MIPS simulator or emulator installed to execute the code.
Readme for Assembly Code 2 (Converting an ASCII PPM Image to Grayscale)

Overview:
This assembly code is designed to perform similar tasks as Code 1. It converts an ASCII PPM image to grayscale, displays the results. The code structure is nearly identical to Code 1.

This assembly code is designed to perform the following tasks:

Read an ASCII PPM image file.
Convert the image to an ASCII PPM image to gray
Write the image to a new PPM file.
How to Use:

Create a new output file (ppm)
In order to run in the code you need to hard code the file path onto my code(for both the input and output files) as mips doesn't read the user input properly
Run the code using a MIPS assembly simulator or emulator.
After execution, the grayscale image will be saved as "greyscale.ppm" in the same directory.
Additional Notes:

Like Code 1, this code uses MIPS assembly language and is intended for execution on a MIPS architecture.
Ensure that you have a compatible MIPS simulator or emulator installed to run the code.
